Natural User Interface for Linggle
=============================================
Linggle provides language usage and frequency information for a large number of cases in context, which has long been recognized as crucial to language learning. However, Linggle commands are not that easily to come out from users’ mind without a brief user guide or some examples. Thus, we have an idea of creating a natural user interface for Linggle. 

The development of  the natural user interface for Linggle will definitely take it to an epoch-making ground. For example, if a user wanted to know which preposition is the best for the word “attention”, he or she can type whatever he or she wants, such as “What preposition is the best goes with attention?”, we will change those questions into Linggle type of queries like “pron. v. attention ?prep. ?n.” as the input and bring back the output from Linggle. Easy and intuitively input format surely help users get what he or she want.
